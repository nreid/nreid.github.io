[bGMYC](/assets/bGMYC_1.0.2.tar.gz): a Bayesian implementation of the general mixed yule-coalescent model for species delimitation. Instructions [here](/assets/bGMYC_instructions_14.03.12.txt). See Reid and Carstens 2012 on my publication page. 

I also wrote an R package (Reid et al. 2013) to check model adequacy of the multispecies coalescent model as implemented in *BEAST using posterior predictive simulation. This package had quite a few dependencies and thus was very fragile and broke quickly as they were updated. A part of the procedure I devised was adapted by [Michael Gruenstaeudl](https://blogs.fu-berlin.de/gruenstaeudl/) into the R package P2C2M, available on CRAN. 

For completeness, here are the [data](/assets/Reid_etal_PPSdata.zip) used in the paper, and the original [package](/assets/starbeastPPS.zip).
