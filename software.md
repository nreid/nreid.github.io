Still gotta get bGMYC and my posterior predictive simulation packages on github. For now find them on my old website [here](https://sites.google.com/site/noahmreid/). 

A part of the posterior predictive simulation procedure was adapted by [Michael Gruenstaeudl](https://blogs.fu-berlin.de/gruenstaeudl/) into the R package P2C2M, available on CRAN.
