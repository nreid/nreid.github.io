![Me and Sarah](/assets/meandsarah.jpg)

I'm interested in diversity, describing its distribution and forces that shape it. In my research I use and develop tools from systematics, evolutionary genetics and ecology to try to understand historical and contemporary forces that influence patterns of species diversity and patterns of genetic diversity within species.

In Fall 2016, I started as an Assistant Research Professor in the [Department of Molecular and Cell Biology](http://mcb.uconn.edu) at the [University of Connecticut](http://uconn.edu).
