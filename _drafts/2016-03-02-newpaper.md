I haven't posted in a while, but the first of several papers from my postdoctoral work in the Whitehead lab has been [published](http://bfg.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/12/20/bfgp.elv060.abstract)!

Reid, Noah M., and Andrew Whitehead. _"Functional genomics to assess biological responses to marine pollution at physiological and evolutionary timescales: toward a vision of predictive ecotoxicology."_ **Briefings in functional genomics** (2015): elv060.
