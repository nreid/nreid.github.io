### Evolution of Extreme Pollution Tolerance in Estuarine Fish 

Developing a deep understanding of how natural selection shapes genetic variation is a central goal of evolutionary biology. Because genome science is in its infancy, we still have a relatively rudimentary understanding of the connections between genotype and phenotype, and how they mediate the effects of selection. I am studying the evolution of extreme pollution tolerance in fishes that inhabit the Atlantic Coast of North America. 

### Sex chromosomes and local adaptation in killifish. 

### Methods in comparative functional genomics. 

### Delimitation of evolutionarily significant units.
