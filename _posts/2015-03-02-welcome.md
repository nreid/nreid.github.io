title: Welcome to my new site. 
---

I'm experimenting with moving my site from [Google Sites](sites.google.com/site/noahmreid) to github pages. I know basically nothing about designing and hosting webpages, but using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) seems like a potentially more intuitive and straightforward approach than using the WYSIWYG editors of google sites or wordpress. Maybe more fun too. 

Also, it'll be simple to incorporate a blog into my page, and lately I've been feeling like blogging some of my struggles with analyzing low coverage next-gen data from a non-model organism might be a useful exercise. 

I got started with the relatively straightforward instructions on [this](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) page and [jekyll's](http://jekyllrb.com/) site.
