Since my last post, I have moved to the University of Connecticut and started a position as Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology. 

I am doing a few things at the moment:

1. putting together my first course (grad level). 
2. writing a couple grants. 
3. trying to finish analyzing data from, writing up, and/or revising work arising from my postdoc with [Andrew Whitehead](https://whiteheadresearch.wordpress.com/) at [UC Davis](http://www.envtox.ucdavis.edu/). 
4. being psyched about the publication this week of some of said work in _Science_!
