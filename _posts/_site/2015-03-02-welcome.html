<p>I’m experimenting with moving my site from <a href="sites.google.com/site/noahmreid">Google Sites</a> to github pages. I know basically nothing about designing and hosting webpages, but using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> seems like a potentially more intuitive and straightforward approach than using the WYSIWYG editors of google sites or wordpress. Maybe more fun too.</p>

<p>Also, it’ll be simple to incorporate a blog into my page, and lately I’ve been feeling like blogging some of my struggles with analyzing low coverage next-gen data from a non-model organism might be a useful exercise.</p>

<p>I got started with the relatively straightforward instructions on <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/">this</a> page and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll’s</a> site.</p>
